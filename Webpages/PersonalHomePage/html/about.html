        <p id = "intro">
            I wanted to work in technology, especially with robotics, since I was a kid. 
            I went to the University of Florida after high school, and majored in Mechanical Engineering. 
            I later switched to Pre-Veterinary Medicine, and failed out in 2006. 
            I moved to Pittsburgh to be with my wife a year later. I always intended to come back to college. 
            Due to financial issues, low wages, and skyrocketing tuition costs, returning felt like little more than a pipe dream. 
            I fell into a depression: I felt stagnated, and that I was trapped in a job I didn't like, with no other options.

            In desperation, I contacted Richard Hooper, a robotics engineer to ask him what I could do to get into his profession. 
            He suggested that I learn software. I started with C++, because it was what I remembered the CS students learned in high school, and acquired a used textbook. 
            I went anywhere information was either cheap, or free, and because of that, was exposed to Python, C#, CSS/HTML, Javascript, and SQL. 
            I joined local developer groups, for .NET, Javascript, SQL, and Azure, and attended all the local conferences I could. 
            My path became fractured: I developed a large breath of knowledge in various software development topics, with little practical depth, and floundered with my own personal projects. 
            I centered my focus in recent years towards mobile development with C#, using the Xamarin library, and web-app development with Javascript. 
            I built a proof-of-concept gallery app in 2019 while learning how to use the Vue Javascript framework

            In late 2019, I committed to returning to college, and started in summer 2020. 
            Due to the degree focus on Java, I continued to build mastery between semesters, by creating proof-of-concept Minecraft mods with Forge; a Java-based modding library. 
            I used degree-required final projects to prototype a major project I worked on in previous years: 
            I created a proof-of-concept database, and started re-designing a Java solution for what was a Vue.js project from 2018, and previously a Xamarin/C# project from 2016. 
            I revisited game development during the winter break in 2021 to make a reptile keeper game, however I did not get past the initial planning stage.
            I was exposed to Android Development, Visual Basic, Systems Design, Networking (physical configuration of connected workstations), C, C++, Data Structures and Algorithms, and Digital Marketing
            in addition to the degree focus. I graduated from the Community College of Allegheny County in the Spring of 2022 with Highest Honors, to recieve an Associates of Science in Software Development.

            During my free time, I enjoy gaming, cooking, nature photography, exercising, and hiking. 
            I am also a part-time professional freelance artist, with experience in both traditional, and digital media.
