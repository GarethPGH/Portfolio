# Portfolio
Portfolio Website I created for Web Development Class.

Portfolio Page includes the main Portfolio Page, as well as three other projects done for class

Personal Page includes homepage, three other pages with a basic about me, contact (no email link), and basic gallery.

LandingPage includes one page with a listing of art services that I offer with examples, however, the purchase buttons are not coded to do anything. This will be changed if I ever launch the page.

GalleryPage includes three galleries of traditional art, digital art, and photography. Buttons are controlled through Javascript so that only one HTML file is utilized. A CSS overlay effect creates an interesting way to display information of each image, and the link to the fullsize image.

Main Portfolio page includes a video embed, and CSS media queries to make the page responsive to multiple screen sizes, and may also work well on mobile phones. 
All websites include the use of CSS flex, or grid to maintain responsiveness for multiple screen sizes, however the other three may not be pleasant on the smallest or largest of screens.
